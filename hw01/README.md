# Homework-01

Open up a new Android Project (API level 22, Empty Project).

Put 1 TextView view to the center of the screen and 2 floatingActionButton views at the bottom of the screen right next to the other in the project with different images.

Change the code of both of the floatingActionButtons so that,
- When the button to the left is clicked, the font of the TextView is changed to 24dp
- When the button to the right is clicked, the font of the TextView is changed to 12dp

**NOTE:** You need to go to the Android Developers web page and find the method for changing the font size of a TextView.
