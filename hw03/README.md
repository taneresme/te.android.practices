Open up a new Android Project (API level 22, Empty Project)

Using the UI you've built in Question 2 (ConstraintLayout version), change the functionality of the three switches as explained below:
- Switch 1 - (visibilitySwitch): If checked, the image should be visible; otherwise it should be invisible.
- Switch 2 - (tintSwitch): If checked, there should be a orange tint over the image (either screen or multiply mode); otherwise no tint.
- Switch 3 - (tintModeSwitch): If checked, the tint should be on screen mode; in unchecked it should be multiply mode.

You can find the details of ImageView views from the following link: ImageViews. Check the method setTintList and setTintMode.
