# Homework-06

Start from the project given in the file named "Sunshine22_Part5_END.zip" in Moodle.

Modify the FetchWeatherTask class so that the RecyclerView object should show the pressure and humidity information for each day instead of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and the weather information.

**Example:**
Each item in RecyclerView should say: "Sun Oct 22 Pr: 1018.6, Hum: 0%"
**HINT:** You have to change the part where you get the max, min, main items inside the JSON object.
